This is the CLI chatbot for the II assignment of the User Interface Construction course at Aalto (November 2019).

- To run the application please, go to the following link: 
https://chatbot-uic2019.herokuapp.com/

- It is possible to run it also on localhost, just by run the chatbot.html file as a standard html file (the only issue will be the username missing).

- A live demo to see how the application works is avaible at the following link:

- In the report there is the description of what I did and how I took the decisions about the User Interface. 

- In the folder "app" there is all the code I wrote and all the libraries I used.

Enjoy!
